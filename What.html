            <p>As women, we have a lot of places to hide things such as weapons. We are discrete with our tactics and
                how we do things. We are all trained security guards so we have the capability of protecting our
                clientele. People would never expect a group of all females to be the ones defending the celebrities, we
                use that as an advantage in order to pop out unexpectedly.
                <span>C.R.O.W.N.</span> took the approach to physical security.
                The technology we use involves lipstick tasers, hair tie boomerangs, earpieces, guns, radios,
                Pepper spray, key knives, bulletproof vests, life 360 app. <span>C.R.O.W.N.</span> is brave enough to
                take a bullet for the client. We are able to drive around clients to their destination and are available
                24/7. The things that we aren't able to do are make arrest, we have to pass it on to the officers. We
                can't also shoot or pull out guns unless our client is being threatened.</p>
